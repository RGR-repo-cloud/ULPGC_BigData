# Matrix Multiplication Performance Comparison

Cross-language benchmark of O(n³) matrix multiplication in C, Java, and Python.

## Quick Start

```bash
./run_all_benchmarks.sh        # Run benchmarks
python3 create_graphs.py       # Generate visualizations
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x, Java JDK 8+, GCC

## Results

Benchmarks matrix sizes 64–1024 with 5 runs each. Generates CSV data and 8 visualizations comparing execution time, memory usage, and statistical distributions across languages.
